This repository is a collection of useful nessus scripts that will help assist on penetration tests

This script accepts a file of IP addresses to be used for external testing. 
The file is parsed and nmap run against the targets on off hours creating 
output files which are uploaded to nessus. Nessus scans are then kicked
off and when done results are emailed back to the user. 

Usage: ruby nessus_http_api.rb [options] <targets_file>
    -v, --verbose                    Output more information
    -n, --server IP                  The IP address of the Nessus server
        --port PORT                  The port of the Nessus server
    -u, --username USER              Username of Nessus account
    -p, --password PASS              Password to Nessus account
    -c, --client CLIENTNAME          The name of the client
    -e, --email EMAIL                The email to return results to
    -s, --sleep                      Sleep tille 6pm
    -a, --attach                     Attaches the Nessus file to email
